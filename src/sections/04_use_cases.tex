Use case scenarios of the approximation technique we discuss have their own constraints and limitations.
For instance, approximation requirements should have precisely specified exponent $j$ in $X^j$ because
for each $j$ there is a matching polynomial $P(m,X,N)$.
Perfectly, there should be a set precompiled polynomials $P(m,X,N)$ matching precise exponent $j$ in $X^j$ over
precisely defined approximation range with required error of approximation $E$ constraint.
